1-	int sockfd = socket(domain, type, protocol)

2-	For communicating between processes on different hosts
     connected by IPV4, we use AF_INET and AF_I NET 6 for processes
      connected by IPV6.

3-	SOCK_STREAM: TCP(reliable, connection oriented)
	SOCK_DGRAM: UDP(unreliable, connectionless)

4-	sockaddr_in is a structure used in C and C++ programming 
	languages to represent an IPv4 socket address.

5-	sockaddr_in is a structure used in C and C++ programming languages to 
      represent an IPv4 socket address.

6-  you can check if a client is disconnected from your server by using the select().

7-	Using a library like 'select', 'poll', or 'epoll' to set up an event loop that will 
    monitor multiple sockets for different events (such as incoming connections or data availability).

8-	accept function to accept the connection 

9-	use the recv function to read the data from the client. 

10-	use the send function to send the data over the client socket.

11-	Close client connections: If a client connection is closed by the client or an error occurs
	, remove the client socket from the event loop and close the socket using the close function.

12-	fd_set is a data structure used in C programming for managing sets of file descriptors.
	 It is typically used in conjunction with functions like select(), pselect(), FD_SET()
	 , FD_CLR(), FD_ISSET(), and FD_ZERO() to perform I/O multiplexing and handle multiple file 
	descriptors efficiently.
